## About Me

I have experience using Typescript, Next.js, React, Svelte, TailwindCSS, and Supabase to develop high-quality web applications. This Stack has allowed me to build my projects so far, but I always think about expanding my knowledge and reaching the next level (Next goal: T3 Stack).

I'm currently working on my own project "Jeenglish", a web application to practice your writing skills and improve your English thanks to the immediate feedback and various tools offered by the app.

Programming has given me the skills to combine all the branches of learning I've been interested in (such as drawing, design, 3D modeling, mathematics, etc.) into a project that can help other people and that gives me so much satisfaction.

I've gained a lot of valuable skills, experiences, and knowledge thanks to the web, so I'm very excited to work on it and give back the value it gave me all my life â™¥.
